Introduction

	Common Utilities is a library of several general utilities classes which are
	not specific to any domain and are intended for heavy reuse across multiple
	OSFramework projects. The primary goal of these utility classes is to
	provide implementations of known best practices that are not already offered
	by the standard Java API.
