Common Utilities
================

Common Utilities is a library of several general utilities classes which are
not specific to any domain and are intended for heavy reuse across multiple
OSFramework projects. The primary goal of these utility classes is to
provide implementations of known best practices that are not already offered
by the standard Java API.
